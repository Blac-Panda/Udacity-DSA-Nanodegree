The solution has a time complexity is O(nlog(n)) and space complexity is O(n), because I used Merge sort.

The numbers in the array are rearranged to two numbers, then the sum of the two numbers is the biggest. Then the array is sorted in descending order. Then we iterate through the set of numbers while checking num1 and num2.
