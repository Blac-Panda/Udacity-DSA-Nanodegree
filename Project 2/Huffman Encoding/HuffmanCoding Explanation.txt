The time complexity of the Huffman algorithm is O(nlogn). 

By using a heap to store the weight of each tree, each iteration requires O(log n) time to place in the priority queue, and there are O(n) iterations, one for each item.

The space complexity is linear O(n) where n is the input size because it scales proportionally to the size of the input.
