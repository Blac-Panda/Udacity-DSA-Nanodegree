I made us of recursion to traverse a directory and its subdirectories when given its 
path and append the files matching the given suffix to an array.

The time complexity is O(n * m) where n is the number of 
files in the current directory and m is the number of folders when we do recursion. 
We have to go through each folder and every file in each folder.

The space complexity is O(n * m) where n is the depth of 
recursion and m is the space each recursive call function occupies.
